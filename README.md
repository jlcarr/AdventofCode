## About Advent of Code
https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode  
From their website's About page:  
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.  

Advent of Code does not seems to have any restrictions on sharing solutions, and even seems to encourage it on Reddit.  
In the spirit of Project Euler's request to make solutions posting to be educational, I am providing approach explanations and linking resources useful links in the READMEs associated with each year I do.

## About These Solutions
- These are my original solutions written in Python 3.
- The intent was to solve these problems as quickly as possible: I frequently time myself.
- Comments are sparse and the intended approach is to be written quickly.
- Solution values, timing on my laptop, and a terse solution approach are given in the READMEs for each year.
- I'm also adding a series of useful links to topics useful to each problem at the end.
- On occasion I will consider different approaches to the problem: the one I end of using remains in the ```AoC[year]_day[day]_[part].py```, while the discarded/incomplete solution will be in another file.
